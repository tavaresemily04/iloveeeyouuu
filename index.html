            <p>Hiiiiiii this is emily. I made this app by scratch using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Before making this I had some experience with HTML which is what im using to type this rn. CSS is used to basically decorate. My first time using it as you can tell. I had to code the font, border, and basically everthing you see here so bare with me.I know it looks sketch but I tried my best. Javascript was used to make the confetti animation, any buttons you see, and to make the music work. I tried to get rid of any bugs as possible.Chat GPT helped me fix the bugs cause I just made it worse. broke this a few times but yeah look around press buttons and stuff. I tried my best with the little skils I had and little time. I actually had fun making this.And yeah I hope you like this </H> </p>
          <p>Edit: I think i broke the car page in the links section. you cant scroll down.ðŸ¥€. its 1 day before your birthday. I cant fix it. chat cant fix it. oh well </p>
